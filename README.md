## cleartemp

automates the clearing of the %temp% folder to save disk space.
remember, not all .bat files are viruses. this isnt one either.

works by deleting the %temp% folder, which is always packed with temporary folders that are useless.

works on my win10 x32 installation, so theres no reason it shouldnt work on yours.
if theres any bugs feel free to complain in issues.

#### DISCLAIMER
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY REKT SKRUBS, NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR IT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT WORKS AS EXPECTED.
